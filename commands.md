Hereâ€™s a list of commonly used Git commands along with their descriptions to help you understand how they work:

### Git Commands with Descriptions

1. **`git init`**

4. **`git add <file>`**

   - **Description**: Commits the staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message, indicating what changes were made.

6. **`git log`**
   - **Description**: Displays the commit history for the current branch, showing commit IDs, authors, dates, and messages.

7. **`git branch`**

8. **`git checkout <branch-name>`**

9. **`git merge <branch-name>`**
   - **Description**: Merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch. This combines the histories of both branches.

10. **`git pull <remote> <branch>`**
    - **Description**: Fetches and merges changes from the specified branch of the remote repository into the current branch.

11. **`git push <remote> <branch>`**
    - **Description**: Uploads local commits to the specified branch of the remote repository.

12. **`git restore <file>`**
    - **Description**: Restores a file in the working directory to its last committed state, effectively discarding any uncommitted changes.

16. **`git diff`**
    - **Description**: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area, or between different commits.

17. **`git reset <commit>`**
    - **Description**: Resets the current branch to a specific commit, potentially changing the state of the working directory and staging area.

18. **`git tag <tag-name>`**

### Example Workflow

1. **Initialize a new repository**:

   ```

2. **Add a new file**:
   ```bash
   touch example.txt
   git add example.txt
   ```

3. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add example file"
   ```

4. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

5. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Git!" >> example.txt
   git add example.txt
   git commit -m "Update example file"
   ```

6. **Merge back to the main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

7. **Push changes to the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
